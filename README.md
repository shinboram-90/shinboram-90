- ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m Lisa Chatellier, to avoid any confusion Shin Boram is simply my Korean name!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in diverse things. I would put travels first because I've been moving around for quite a while and it's trully addictive. My curiosity has no limit and if one day I get the chance to visit every country on this planet I will not think twice about it!

  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all different types of programming languages but I do have a preference for Javascript. The way it changes the whole user experience is mind-blowing!!!

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: check out my portfolio at www.lisachatellier.com still a work in progress but I'm getting there...
